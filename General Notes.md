There are two things to keep in mind throughout the entire Taubman approach. 

# 1. All movements work together

Even if movements are presented one at a time, they all work together from the very start of one's work with the approach.

Rotation, In-Out, Up-Down, Side-Side: these movements all work together.

# 2. Practice motions are larger than performance motions
Oftentimes, while in the practice room, we will do larger versions of movements that we will do in performance.
